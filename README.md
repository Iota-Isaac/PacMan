### About  

The game was made using [Processing](https://processing.org).

The rules are pretty straight forward : eat the food , don't be the food.  
I succeed adding the A* algorithm, I was using Gandalf to help me.

### What's New?
* Tricky, the one who is always drunk
* Pinky, it's not the smart type
