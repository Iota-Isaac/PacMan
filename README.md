### About  

The game was made using [Processing](https://processing.org).

The rules are pretty straight forward : eat the food , don't be the food.  

### What's New?
* A nice looking path
* Ghost interaction with Pacman
* Weak Mode for ghosts
* Auto return to home when a ghost is eaten by Pacman
* Few bugs fixed
